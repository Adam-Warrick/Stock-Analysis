# **Stock-Analysis**

## **Overview of the Project**
 Our client would like to run an analysis on stock tickers to determine which stock has the best return for his parents. To complete this project I used VBA Macros to run the analysis. The first set of script worked well, however, we refactored the code to make it run more efficient and faster. 
 
 
 
## **Results**
The first version of code gave me the answers I was looking forever, however, it was a little slow. When I refactored the code, it made a staggering improvement on time to answer. We needed to refactor in this case as we want to expand our data search. If we did not refactor and added more tickers this would be a very slow macro which creates inefficiencies.

**Refactored Code**


## **Summary**
In this case it is proven that Refactoring is the way to go in order to be more efficient.

###### Advantages
Our refactored code ran quicker and more efficient then our previous original code. However, the original code was slightly easier to build as it gave more steps in understanding how to write everything out that made it flow well. 

###### Disadvantages
Some disadvantages for the original code was that it was slow, clunky, and inefficient. The refactored code seemed slightly harder to build as a deeper understanding of the variables was needed.
